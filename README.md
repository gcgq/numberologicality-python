## numberologicality

This is a [numerology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerology) app built in Flask and Firebase. I've been a bit of a purist about it so far, eschewing CSS and JS frameworks. I previously had a another version of this up on Heroku (built with Ruby, Sinatra, and MongoDB) but that's broken now, and I forgot the e-mail I used for that Heroku account ðŸ™ƒ, so I'll fix that someday. Till then, here's a Python version. Still needs a bit of polish, like an options menu, maybe some editing features, and a more dynamic user experience. But for now, it works pretty good.
